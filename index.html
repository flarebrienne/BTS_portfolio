            <p class="para">BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band that was
                formed
                in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.[5] The septet—consisting of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM,
                Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical
                style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary,
                touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards
                loving
                oneself, and individualism. Their work also often references literature and psychological concepts and includes an
                alternative universe storyline.</p>
